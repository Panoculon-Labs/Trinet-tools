# IMU ↔ Video Time Synchronization (UVC / NCM stream)

This note explains how to align a Trinet camera's IMU with its video frames, in
two layers:

1. **Per-frame timing** — put each frame on the IMU's clock using the hardware
   capture timestamp embedded in the stream (removes video delivery latency →
   sub-frame precision).
2. **Post-calibration offset** — apply the Kalibr-calibrated `timeshift_cam_imu`
   to remove the residual constant offset (rolling-shutter readout centre + IMU
   group delay + pipeline). This is the layer that gets you to a VIO-grade,
   physically-correct alignment.

## TL;DR

- The **hardware frame-capture timestamp is embedded in the video stream**, in
  the IMU SEI of every frame (and recovered into `.vts` as `sof_timestamp_ns`).
- A measured IMU↔video offset of ~30–40 ms is **video delivery latency** (encode +
  USB transport + host decode/jitter buffer), *not* a sync error. It appears only
  if you compare against the **decoded frame's arrival / presentation time (PTS)**.
- Align the IMU against each frame's **`sof_timestamp_ns`** instead — both are on
  the camera's monotonic clock and are latched in hardware, so delivery latency
  cancels out and the nearest IMU sample lands **sub-millisecond** from the frame.
- For the final, physically-correct alignment, **add the Kalibr `timeshift_cam_imu`**
  (≈ −16.5 ms here). `sof_timestamp_ns` gives you sub-ms *precision*; the timeshift
  removes the systematic *offset* between the frame's reported time and its true
  effective capture instant. See [Post-calibration refinement](#post-calibration-refinement-kalibr-timeshift).

## Which version do I have? (and how to sync it)

Trinet recordings have evolved across hardware generations and firmware, so the
exact timestamp you align to depends on the format version. You can identify it
without guessing:

- **From a UVC `.mp4`:** run `extract_sei` (below). It prints
  `version=N  fsync=…  mag=…` — `N` is the in-stream **SEI version** — and writes
  the sidecars.
- **From sidecars directly:** the version is a `uint32` right after the 8-byte
  magic. `read_imu(...).header.version` / `read_vts(...).header.version`, or by
  hand: bytes 8–11 of `*.imu` (magic `TRIMU001`) and of `*.vts` (magic `TRIVTS01`).

| What you have | `.imu` ver | `.vts` ver | SEI ver | Generation | Frame timestamp (`sof`) | How to time-sync |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Earliest | 1–2 | 1 | — | pre-release | frame time only, no `sof` | limited — frame-level only |
| **Frame-sync** | 3–4 | 2 / 3 | 3 / 4 | legacy (v1/v2 hardware) | `sof = sample_ts − fsync_delay_us` (**start-of-frame**, from the frame-sync pulse) | align IMU → `sof`, then **+ `timeshift_cam_imu`** |
| **Magnetometer, no mid-exposure** | 5 | 2 / 3 | 5 | v3 generation, early firmware | host-latched **start-of-frame** (in `.vts sof_timestamp_ns`; **0 if extracted from UVC** — use the device's on-board `.vts`) | align IMU → `sof`, then **+ `timeshift_cam_imu`** |
| **Mid-exposure** *(current)* | 5 | 4 | 6 | v3 generation, current firmware | **mid-exposure** frame time, plus `exposure_us` + `readout_time_us` | align IMU → `sof`, **+ `timeshift_cam_imu`**, optional `line_delay` |

Key points:
- **Every version** aligns the IMU to the same thing — the per-frame `sof` on the
  camera's monotonic clock — and **never** to the video PTS. The differences are
  only *where the `sof` comes from* and *what it is referenced to*.
- **Start-of-frame vs mid-exposure** matters for the residual offset: on
  mid-exposure (`.vts` v4) recordings the exposure term is already removed, so the
  calibrated `timeshift_cam_imu` only has to absorb the readout-centre + sensor
  group delay; on the older start-of-frame recordings the timeshift additionally
  absorbs the exposure-centre. Either way you apply it the same way — just use the
  `timeshift` from **that recording's** calibration.
- **Magnetometer-generation (`.imu` v5) cameras over UVC, SEI v5:** the SEI carries
  no per-frame hardware timestamp, so `extract_sei` leaves `sof = 0`. Use the
  camera's **on-board `.vts`** (which has the host-latched `sof`), or update the
  camera to current firmware (SEI v6 → `.vts` v4, `sof` recoverable from the stream).

The two sections below detail the current (mid-exposure) format; everything
generalises across versions via the table above.

## What's actually in the stream

Each encoded video frame is preceded by an SEI NAL carrying the IMU samples for
that frame plus a per-frame timing block. `extract_sei` recovers this into the
`.imu` + `.vts` sidecars, where `read_vts` exposes:

- **`sof_timestamp_ns`** — the frame's hardware capture time on the camera's
  monotonic clock. On current recordings this is referenced to the **centre of the
  exposure window** (mid-exposure); the `TIMING_MID_EXPOSURE` flag says which.
- **`exposure_us`** — the applied integration time (when `TIMING_EXPOSURE_VALID`).
- **`readout_time_us`** — the rolling-shutter readout span, first row → last row
  (when `TIMING_READOUT_VALID`). The per-row delay (Kalibr's `line_delay`) is
  `readout_time_us / image_height`.

(Older recordings instead carry a per-sample `fsync_delay_us` in the `.imu`, the
offset from each sample to the hardware frame-sync pulse; `extract_sei` subtracts it
to produce the same `sof_timestamp_ns`.)

Because the IMU and the frame timestamp are carried **together** inside the same
SEI, their relationship is fixed no matter how long the encoded frame takes to be
delivered and decoded. **Never align the IMU against the video PTS / frame arrival
time** — that timeline includes the delivery latency.

## Recover it with `extract_sei`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Panoculon-Labs/Trinet-tools.git
cd Trinet-tools
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt          # ffmpeg/ffprobe must be on PATH

python3 -m trinet_tools.extract_sei your_recording.mp4 --out out/
# -> out/imu.bin     (TRIMU: all IMU samples)
# -> out/frames.bin  (TRIVTS: per-frame sof_timestamp_ns + venc_pts)
# -> out/video.mp4   (clean, decodable copy)
```

`frames.bin` carries the hardware **`sof_timestamp_ns`** for every frame. That is
the timeline to align IMU to.

## Verify the per-frame timing

```python
from trinet_tools.reader import read_imu, read_vts
import numpy as np

imu = read_imu("out/imu.bin")
vts = read_vts("out/frames.bin")

sof = vts.sof_timestamps_ns.astype(np.int64)     # per-frame hardware capture time (ns)
imu_ts = imu.timestamps_ns.astype(np.int64)      # IMU sample times (same monotonic clock)

# 1) Frame cadence from the hardware timestamp (should be a clean 30 fps)
d = np.diff(sof) / 1e6                            # ms
print(f"cadence: {d.mean():.3f} ms ({1000/d.mean():.2f} fps), "
      f"std {d.std():.3f} ms, monotonic={bool(np.all(d > 0))}")

# 2) Distance from each frame timestamp to the nearest IMU sample
idx = np.clip(np.searchsorted(imu_ts, sof), 1, len(imu_ts) - 1)
nearest_us = np.minimum(np.abs(imu_ts[idx] - sof), np.abs(imu_ts[idx-1] - sof)) / 1e3
print(f"frame-to-nearest-IMU: median {np.median(nearest_us):.3f} us, "
      f"95th pct {np.percentile(nearest_us, 95):.3f} us")
```

On a representative v6 recording (96.9 s, 2 907 frames, 400 Hz IMU) this prints:

```
cadence: 33.333 ms (30.00 fps), std 0.519 ms, monotonic=True
frame-to-nearest-IMU: median 838.583 us, 95th pct 1191.529 us
```

The IMU sample nearest each frame's timestamp is **sub-millisecond at the median**
(~0.84 ms) and ~1.2 ms at the 95th percentile — bounded by the IMU sample period
(≈2.5 ms at 400 Hz, i.e. ≤ ½ period). That is *precision* on the IMU timeline. To
place a frame on that timeline, use its `sof_timestamp_ns` (or interpolate the IMU
at that time); never use the frame's PTS / arrival time.

> **Precision vs. accuracy.** The number above is how close the nearest IMU sample
> is to the frame *timestamp* — it does **not** mean the frame *timestamp* equals
> the frame's true capture instant. There is a constant systematic offset between
> the two; the next section calibrates and removes it.

## Post-calibration refinement (Kalibr `timeshift_cam_imu`)

Aligning to `sof_timestamp_ns` removes the (large, variable) delivery latency, but a
**constant residual offset** remains between the frame's reported timestamp and the
instant the scene was actually integrated onto the sensor. For a rolling-shutter
camera with a wide fisheye + IMU, that residual is:

- **Rolling-shutter readout centre.** A frame is read out top row → bottom row over
  `readout_time_us` (26.47 ms in the example), so different rows are exposed at
  different instants; the natural single reference is the **middle row** (the frame's
  temporal centre). Current firmware applies this on-device — `sof_timestamp_ns`
  already references the middle row (the `TIMING_FRAME_CENTERED` flag, `0x08`, is
  set), so **this ~`readout/2` ≈ 13.2 ms term is already removed** and does not
  appear in the residual. *Older recordings* with `FRAME_CENTERED` **clear** reference
  the **top row**, so for those the residual still contains the full **+~13.2 ms**.
  (Either way `sof` is mid-*exposure*, so the exposure time cancels and the offset
  does **not** drift with auto-exposure.)
- **+ IMU group delay + pipeline latency** — the inertial sensor's internal
  filtering delays its samples by a few ms, plus small constant ISP/transport
  offsets. This is the dominant residual for frame-centred recordings.

These sum to a stable per-design constant. Kalibr's camera–IMU calibration estimates
exactly this as **`timeshift_cam_imu`**, written into `calibration.json`. **Its value
differs between the two conventions** (it shrinks by ~`readout/2` once the firmware
references the middle row), so do **not** reuse a `timeshift_cam_imu` measured on
top-row recordings with frame-centred ones — recompute after a firmware update that
changes `FRAME_CENTERED`. Example layout:

```json
"extrinsics": {
  "timeshift_cam_imu_sec": -0.01652,
  "timeshift_sign_convention": "t_imu = t_cam + timeshift_cam_imu_sec"
}
```

### Applying it

To convert a frame's timestamp into the IMU clock, add the timeshift:

```python
import json
cal = json.load(open("calibration.json"))
dt = cal["extrinsics"]["timeshift_cam_imu_sec"]          # e.g. -0.0156 s

# IMU state that corresponds to frame i:
t_imu_ns = sof[i] + int(dt * 1e9)                        # t_imu = t_cam + timeshift
# then interpolate the IMU (accel/gyro) at t_imu_ns.
```

Use the calibrated `timeshift_cam_imu` rather than hand-deriving it — it folds the
readout centre, the IMU group delay, and the pipeline latency into one measured
number, and it is consistent across same-design units (typ. −15 to −16.5 ms, spread
< 1 ms). It is the same value your VIO / fusion stack should consume as the
camera–IMU time offset.

### Per-row (rolling-shutter) precision

For pixel-accurate work, account for the rolling shutter per row. Row `r` is
captured at:

```
t_row(r) = sof_timestamp_ns + timeshift + (r - r_ref) * line_delay
line_delay = readout_time_us * 1000 / image_height        # ns per row
r_ref      = image_height / 2   if TIMING_FRAME_CENTERED (0x08) is set
           = 0  (top row)       otherwise (older firmware)
```

`r_ref` is the row that `sof_timestamp_ns` references, and you **must** pick it from
the `TIMING_FRAME_CENTERED` (`0x08`) flag — **not** from `TIMING_MID_EXPOSURE`:
current firmware sets `FRAME_CENTERED`, so `sof` references the **middle** row
(`r_ref = H/2`); older firmware leaves it clear and `sof` references the **top** row
(`r_ref = 0`). (`TIMING_MID_EXPOSURE` only says `sof` is exposure-centred in *time*,
not which *row* it references.) `readout_time_us` is a fixed property of the sensor
mode (26.47 ms over 1080 rows = 24.5 µs/row on the example) and is available per-frame
in v4+ `.vts`. `trinet_tools.reader.VtsData.row_offset_s(r, image_height)` implements
the `(r − r_ref)·line_delay` term with the correct branch. Most consumers can ignore
all of this and treat the frame as captured at `sof + timeshift`; VIO front-ends that
model the rolling shutter should use `line_delay` with the flag-selected `r_ref`.
